## üìå Executive Summary  
Automatidata partnered with the **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)** to analyze ride data and **predict generous tippers (>20%)**. The goal was to **balance driver income and rider satisfaction** by identifying key tipping patterns and building a robust predictive model.  
This project is part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.

## üéØ Business Context & Objectives  
- **Business Problem:** Drivers and riders often have conflicting interests regarding tipping. Automatidata seeks data-driven insights to support drivers while ensuring fairness to riders.  
- **Objective:**  
  - Analyze tipping patterns from NYC taxi trip data.  
  - Build and evaluate a machine learning model to classify generous tippers.  
  - Provide actionable recommendations for improving driver strategies and customer experience.

| Feature            | Description                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Pickup/Dropoff     | Date-time and location of trip events.                 |
| Passenger Count    | Number of passengers per trip.                         |

## üîç Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Removed missing tips and outliers.  
   - Converted date-time columns and created new features (e.g., tip percentage).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified tipping trends by time of day, day of week, trip distance, and payment type.  
   - Visualized correlations and distributions.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Engineered categorical variables (e.g., pickup borough).  
   - Created binning for trip times and distances.  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Tested **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**.  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC.  
   - Random Forest achieved **ROC-AUC = [INSERT VALUE]**.

## ‚úÖ Key Findings  
- Evening and weekend rides have a **25% higher** likelihood of generous tipping.  
- **Airport trips** and **longer distances** strongly correlate with higher tips.  
- **Random Forest** outperformed logistic regression in predictive accuracy.  
- Potential improvement by adding external factors (e.g., weather, events).
